Deck of Cards

Given Problem Statement:

We will be utilizing the APIs available from http://deckofcardsapi.com/
· Implement automation to test the following APIs in c#
o Create a new deck of cards
§ GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/
§ Support adding Jokers with a POST
o Draw one or more cards from a deck
§ GET https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/<<deck_id>>/draw/
· Code should be executable, please provide a README that indicates how to run it.
· Should run with ‘Nunit test’
· Submit solution via a repo on https://github.com/

Written two test cases as per above 
1.  Create a new deck of cards with Validations with cpmbination of data with Jokers= true
2.  Draw one or more cards from a deck with diffenrt combinations of test data 

Developer Reusable functions of GET and using Nunit as testing framework 
used OOPS concepts to write test cases 

We can excute test scripts using  NUnit3TestAdapter and Nuit-Console
